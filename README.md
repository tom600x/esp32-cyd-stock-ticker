# ESP32 CYD Stock Ticker

A stock and cryptocurrency price tracker for the ESP32 Cheap Yellow Display (CYD / ESP32-2432S028).
Displays live prices, percentage change, and portfolio value on the built-in 2.8" TFT touchscreen.
Configured entirely via a browser, no code changes required.

## Changes in This Fork

This fork adds an option to display each ticker's price change as either a percentage or a USD amount:

- Enable **Show dollar change** in the browser configuration to switch from values such as `+1.25%` to `+$2.40`.
- The selected format is used consistently in the ticker grid, ticker detail view, and browser dashboard.
- The setting is saved in ESP32 non-volatile storage and remains selected after a restart. Percentage change remains the default.
- USD change is calculated from the current price and previous close for stocks, or the reconstructed 24-hour opening price for crypto.

The fork also changes the first default ticker from `AAPL` to `AMZN` and sets `TFT_INVERSION_OFF` in `User_Setup.h` for displays that require non-inverted colours.
